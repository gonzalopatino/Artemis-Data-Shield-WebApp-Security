#Project Overview
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that required secure communications for their web application to protect sensitive client data. The company faced issues with ensuring the secure transmission of data and wanted to address potential vulnerabilities in their web application to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

Key Accomplishments
1. Identifying and Mitigating Vulnerabilities
I successfully identified and mitigated vulnerabilities in the web application by implementing secure coding practices, such as:

Strong Encryption Algorithms: Utilized AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with SHA-256 for hashing to ensure a high level of security.
Secure Keystore Generation: Generated a secure keystore for HTTPS communication.
Coding securely is crucial to protect sensitive data from cyber threats and unauthorized access. Software security enhances a company's reputation, ensures compliance with regulatory requirements, and protects against financial losses and legal liabilities.

2. Overcoming Challenges
The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was configuring the application properties for SSL and ensuring the self-signed certificate was properly recognized by the system. This process provided a deeper understanding of SSL/TLS configuration and the importance of secure communications in web applications.

3. Increasing Layers of Security
To enhance security, I implemented multiple layers of protection:

HTTPS with Self-Signed Certificate: Secured communications using HTTPS.
AES Encryption: Ensured secure data transmission with AES encryption.
In the future, I would use tools like the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin to regularly assess vulnerabilities and determine appropriate mitigation techniques. Additionally, I would follow industry-standard best practices for secure coding and configuration.

4. Ensuring Functionality and Security
I ensured the code and software application were functional by:

Application Startup Verification: Ran the application and verified successful startup without errors.
Endpoint Verification: Accessed the /hash endpoint via a web browser at https://localhost:8443/hash to confirm it returned the expected SHA-256 checksum.
After refactoring the code, I checked for new vulnerabilities using the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin, which identified and addressed any known vulnerabilities in the project dependencies.

5. Tools and Resources
I utilized several resources and tools that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks:

OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin: For vulnerability assessment.
Keytool Command: For generating a keystore.
Secure Coding Practices: Including the use of strong encryption algorithms (AES with SHA-256).
6. Demonstrating Skills to Employers
This project showcases my ability to:

Configure secure communications using HTTPS with a self-signed certificate.
Implement encryption algorithms for secure data transmission.
Use tools like the OWASP Dependency-Check plugin to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
